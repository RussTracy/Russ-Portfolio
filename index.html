                I am a detail-oriented professional who has been consistently praised as quality-oriented by my
                co-workers and management. Over the course of my 18-year career, I've developed a skill set directly
                relevant to the Web developer role, including a strong knowledge of HTML, CSS and
                scripting languages. I have experience in working with other developers remotely to accomplish desired
                results. I am self-motivated and can work alone to meet deadlines or with a team of developers. Overall,
                I have consistently demonstrated teamwork, problem-solving and interpersonal abilities in every aspect
                of my web developer role at Marriott International.
